wonk-key
========

Gangsta media keys for computers without.



My finger hitty weapon of choice has long been the gigantic Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard, and more recently the wireless 7000 variant. The latest revision, the Sculpt, is quite nice, but lacks usable media and function keys. Both of these are a must for the astute office warrior.

This first revision of wonk-key is an [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com) script that remaps the keys on the separate numeric keypad included with the Sculpt. The scripted keys are intended for using the keypad turned 90 degrees to the left.
